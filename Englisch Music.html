		<p style="text-align:center; font-size:25px">Music can be relaxing or stressful. I personally love music because i <br>
		can imagine new adventures while hearing music. I'm playing the violin which is <br> another reason whiy i like music. :) I hear a lot of music. 
		I hear music at every daily <br> activity like doing homework, cuddle my rat or play with my ferrets. If you have <br> 
		a stressful day just hear music for a while. Depending on what music you like different music is <br> going to make you feel different. but you don't have to play an instument to love music.
